# DailyBriefing

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/DailyBriefing`. 

This is a Ruby based CLI weather information retriever. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'DailyBriefing'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install DailyBriefing

## Usage

./bin/DailyBriefing

Enter US based ZIP code for basic current weather information.  Press '1' for 36 hours of forecast.  Press '2' to exit. 

## Development

-- I dunno about the rake stuff.  YMMV. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
